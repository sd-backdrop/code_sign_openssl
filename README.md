Code Sign OpenSSL
=================

TODO

Foo project enables you to do bar. The first paragraph of this file should be
kept short as it will be used as the project summary on backdropcms.org. Aim for
about 240 characters (three lines at 80 characters each).

All lines in this file should be no more than 80 characters long for legibility,
unless including a URL or example that requires the line not wrap. (The first
line of this paragraph is 80 characters for reference.)

Detail in READMEs should be limited to the minimum required for installation and
getting started. More detailed documentation should be moved to a GitHub wiki
page: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/setup/wiki/Documentation.
